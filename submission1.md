## Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification

### Why Signed Commits Are Important

Signed commits ensure the authenticity and integrity of changes in a Git repository. They allow collaborators to verify that a commit was truly created by the person it claims to be from, and that the commit hasnâ€™t been tampered with.

In collaborative or open-source projects, unsigned commits could potentially be faked. Using signed commits provides:

- Trust: Developers and reviewers know changes come from a verified contributor.
- Security: Prevents malicious or impersonated commits.
- Accountability: Easier tracking of who introduced what changes.

GitHub recognizes signed commits and marks them with a Verified badge.
